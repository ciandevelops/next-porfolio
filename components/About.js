            I am an Irish ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª, Toronto ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ based Web Developer who worked in
            Retail Management for 8 years. I have dabbled with programming
            languages and computers in general from a very young age. The
            pandemic made me put my head down and work toward what I&apos;m
            passionate about. I hope to continue learning and achieve my dream
            of switching careers. I actively use Udemy, TeamTreeHouse,
            FreeCodeCamp and more, to bring my skills to a new level as I look
            for a full-time role. I look forward to hearing from you.
